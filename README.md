# IPL-Analysis-Dashboard

## IPL Dashboard – Power BI Project
This project is a Power BI dashboard I built to analyze the Indian Premier League (IPL) from 2008 to the most recent season. It’s designed to give a clear and interactive view of how each season unfolded — from which team took the trophy to which players stood out with their performances.

### Why I Built This
I wanted to create something that goes beyond just numbers — a dashboard that tells the story of each IPL season. Cricket fans (like me), analysts, or even team strategists can use it to quickly get answers to questions like:

Who won this season and who came close?

Which players dominated with the bat or ball?

How did each team perform across the points table?

### What You Can Do With It
Here’s what makes the dashboard powerful and fun to explore:

### 🏆 Season Snapshot

View the champion and runner-up teams at a glance.

Use a dropdown to switch between seasons and see how the league evolved.

### 🔥 Player Highlights
Spot the Orange Cap and Purple Cap winners each season.

See who smashed the most fours and sixes.

Each player’s name, team, and image make it visually engaging and easy to understand.

### 📊 Team Points Table
See how each team performed: matches played, wins, losses, ties, and total points.

A great way to compare team consistency across the league.

### 📌 Key Stats
Get quick insights into total sixes, fours, centuries, and venues used in a season.

A fun way to track how explosive or competitive each season was.

### What I Learned
Building this dashboard taught me how to:

Work with sports data that's updated annually

Design clean, interactive visuals that are both informative and fun to explore

Bring together statistics, storytelling, and visuals in one place

### Who’s It For
Whether you're an IPL fan, a data enthusiast, or someone curious about how data can tell stories — this dashboard is built for you. With just a few clicks, you can explore years of IPL action and insights.
